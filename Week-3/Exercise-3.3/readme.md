## Answer

The result is "Count is 0"

When we are calling createIncrement() function that time its calling both functions inside it step by step. so that time it stored the value of message in a variable

after that we are calling increment() function three times that result its incremented our count value to "3" but message value is still remain same.

then we are calling log() function at the end that time whatever value is stored in message variable its getting logged.
